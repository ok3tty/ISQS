ISQS 5346
Problem 1
Load in the following dataset which consists of men’s track records in a set of events for a
set of countries.
track <-
read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricBrownTTU/ISQS5346/main/menstr
ack.csv")
Use the above dataset and R to do the following.
a. For the 100-meter dash and 200-meter dash, compute the following summary
statistics: mean, median, variance, standard deviation.
b. Does does the use of the mode on the above data provide significant analytical
value? Why or why not?
c. Calculate the z-score for each of the observations in each of the two variables above.
Which observations are the most extreme? Should we consider these values
outliers?
d. Create a dataset consisting of only the two variables above. Use cbind to incorporate
a new variable corresponding to the 3000-meter run. Now with three variables, use
the cor function to create a correlation matrix, which displays the correlations
between each pairing of the three variables simultaneously. Comment on the
relationships between the three events. Are they what you would expect?
Problem 2
Load in the TTU graduate student exit survey data.
track <-
read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricBrownTTU/ISQS5346/main/pgs.cs
v")
Use the above dataset and R to do the following.
a. Consider the following two variables: FacTeaching and COL. These data describe the
score the students gave their instructors’ teaching ability and the college in which
the students were enrolled. Use the table function to construct a contingency table
of these two variables.
b. Use prop.table with your table from part (a) as input to construct another
contingency table showing the same information as proportions (i.e., so that all
values sum to 1).
c. Using your solution from part (b), find the probability that a student is from the
College of Education (ED) and rated their instructors at a value of 4.
d. Using your solution from part (b), find the probability that a randomly-selected
student is from the College of Business Administration (BA).
e. Using your solution from part (b), find the probability that a randomly selected
student rated their instructors at a value of 2?
f. Using your solution from part (b), find the conditional probability that, given the fact
that a student is from the College of Arts and Sciences (AS), the student rated their
instructors at a value of 3?
g. Using your solution from part (b), find the conditional probability that, given the fact
that instructors were rated at a value of 5, the student was from the College of Visual
and Performing Arts (VPA)?
h. Using the data above, assess the quality of teaching between the College of Business
Administration (BA) and the College of Education (ED).
Problem 3
Suppose you have five coins numbered 1-5. Further suppose that when coin 𝑖 is flipped it
shows heads with probability 𝑖/5.
We can generate all possible combinations of values of each of the five coin tosses as
follows.
c1 <- c(0,1) # possible outcomes from flipping coin 1
c2 <- c(0,1) # possible outcomes from flipping coin 2
c3 <- c(0,1) # possible outcomes from flipping coin 3
c4 <- c(0,1) # possible outcomes from flipping coin 4
c5 <- c(0,1) # possible outcomes from flipping coin 5
# creating a set of all combinations, note that we could just use
# expand.grid(c1,c2,c3,c4,c5) but the below context let's us have colum names
x <- expand.grid(c1 = c1,c2 = c2, c3 = c3, c4 = c4, c5 = c5)
Use R to do the following.
a. Assuming that all five coins were fair coins (i.e., flipped heads with probability 0.5),
use R to determine the expected number of heads.
Hint: You can use mean() and rowSums() on x created above to do so.
b. Simulate 10,000 trials of the above experiment flipping five coins. You will need to
use the sample() function to do so. I will suggest some code to get you started.
Finish the code below and run it to finalize your simulation. Then, use rowSums() to
obtain the number of heads for each of your 10,000 trials.
results <- data.frame(matrix(nrow = 10000, ncol = 5))
results[,1] <- sample(c(0,1), size = 10000, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1 -
(1/5), 1/5))
results[,2] <- sample(c(0,1), size = 10000, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1 -
(2/5), 2/5))
c. Create a histogram of the results of your experiment with appropriately-labeled
axes and plot title. Comment on what you see. Why are there no outcomes
associated with zero heads?
d. Suppose one coin is randomly selected and flipped. From your experimental results,
find the probability that it is coin 4 given that the result is heads. Then calculate this
probability by hand using Bayes’ rule. If you are interested, you can use R to
document your math, or you can complete your work (neatly) by hand, take a
picture, and import that into your Markdown document using or something similar
to the following, where the figure math.png is in the same directory as my
Rmarkdown file. Note that the code below is inside of an r chunk.
